# Endstagram â€“ Capostone Project

Endstagram is a game app that propomotes analog activities, by offering ideas for off-screen entertainment. Understanding the influence of the screens on our health, I created this app, to encourage the users to activate their sensorium, by playing very-simple, and hopefully, fun games. 
The users can browse already existing activites, specify their preferences, rate the games, but also add their own games. 

They can as well edit or delete their own cards.
I would be very happy if you tried it out and add a game of your own :) 

## Demo:
You can find the hosted version on Vercel: [Demo Version of Endstagram] (https://endstagram.vercel.app/)

Important: This demo is optimized for mobile screen.
