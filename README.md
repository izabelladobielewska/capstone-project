# Endstagram â€“ Capstone Project

I created this app, to propomote analog activities, by offering ideas for off-screen entertainment. Understanding the influence of the screens on our health. Endstagram encourages the users to activate their sensorium (beyond the eyes and thumbs), by proposing very-simple, and hopefully, fun games.

The users can browse already existing activites. They can specify their preferences, rate the games, but also add their own games. 

They can as well edit or delete their own cards.

I would be very happy if you tried it out and add a game of your own :) 

## Demo:
[Endstagram hosted on Vercel](https://endstagram.vercel.app/)

(Optimized for mobile screen, so far.)
